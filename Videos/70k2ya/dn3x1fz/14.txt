My grandma rear ended a line of stopped cars on the highway at full speed,


 no brakes,


 with my 5 year old brother in the car because she thought she saw a deer on the side of the road.


 She's been in another,


 less serious wreck,


 and has come to a dead stop while on the highway because she forgot where she was going multiple times since then.


 My dad had to unplug her battery and tell her that her car doesn't work anymore so she would start asking for rides.


 I would love if they took age into account in someway,


 I'm not an expert on anything so I don't know how they would do it,


 so that families wouldn't have to be torn between treating their elders like a child or worrying if they're going to get a call from the hospital any time they're behind the wheel.
