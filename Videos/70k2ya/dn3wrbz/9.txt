All for it.


 When I was 14 my friend was coming to my house and he got killed by my next door neighbor who happened to be elderly.


 My friend was on his skateboard and he was just up the street from my house.


 From the position of his body and where elderly guy stopped his car I could see he made a super sharp left turn that killed him and ran over my other friend.


 The other friend survived and recovered from his injuries.


 But my other friend not so lucky.


 Oh and my grand dad has Alzheimer's and frequently forgets where he is,


 and I think he still has his license,


 though my grandma finally took his keys.
