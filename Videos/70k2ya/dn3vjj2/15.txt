My fiancee's brother was killed riding his motorcycle  Sunday by a 91 year old who pulled out in front of him.


 He left behind a wife and 3 children.


 He was the one of the best guys I ever met.


 We are all devastated and it could have been prevented.


 That man had no business behind the wheel.
