*Let me say this about that:*The neighbor I love is 93 and still driving,


 when she's up to it.


 She can barely see the on/off switch on her vacuum cleaner.


Should she be driving?


I want her to maintain independence; but at the same time,


 I don't think it's safe for her or others.


 Yet the DMV doesn't require her to take a vision exam or a competency test.
