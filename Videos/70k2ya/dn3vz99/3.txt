Old retired guy here....


74 years old to be precise.


I would accept such a test provided it was only to catch really age related diseases.


  (Dementia,


 poor reflexes,


 etc.


)I live in a retirement community and most of the people who should not have a license have already given them up.


  The first day I was here I heard a conversation between two guys.


Guy One:  I just turned 88 and turned in my driver's license.


Guy Two: Why would you do that?


Guy One: I don't want to spend the rest of my life in jail.
