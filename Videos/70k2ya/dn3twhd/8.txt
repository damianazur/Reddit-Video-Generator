Ugh please.


 My grandma is practically blind and went to take her driving vision test to renew her license.


 She failed,


 but the lady at the DMV felt bad so she had her take it again and gave her hints so she could pass it.


 So now my practically blind grandma is out on the roads still.


 It's for their safety as much as anyone else's.


 I'm so mad that the lady at the DMV was so irresponsible as to let her keep driving.
