All these chumps that want to jump into $100 USD notes...


 Jump into a pool filled with 1000 Swiss Frank notes.


 It's the largest easily available domination if paper currency,


 and does not have any real usage limits.


Each note is worth a little over 1000 USD.


Crumple up a bunch of them at the area you are going to land in,


 have stacks of fresh notes everywhere else.


Deposit them into your new Swiss bank account afterwards.


 LolEdit: I didn't say the Singapore 10000 note,


 because you have usage limitations,


 I remember there being a rule where you can only use 2 or 3 at a time.


 The Swiss Frank is at least somewhat realistic.


Edit2: RIP my inbox...
