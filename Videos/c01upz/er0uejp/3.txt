a 50/50 mixture of water and platinum dust.


 the water would absorb most of the fall then you could evaporate the water and get/sell the platinum for 816$ an ounce.


 As platinum doesnt react with water there is no risk of rust or anything.


 The worlds largest swimming pool can hold 66 Million gallons of water.


 Assuming roughly half the space is used to store the platinum dust thats 1 Gallon = 128 ounces /2 64 ounces \* 66 Million \* 816 = 3,446,784,000,000$.


 Get shit on Bezos.


EDIT:As  u/albathazar pointed out i used the wrong ounce its actually 77.1 trillion
