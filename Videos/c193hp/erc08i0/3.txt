When I was about 10 years old,


 my mom told me that when she was 12 years old,


 she was in bed at night (she lived in Puerto Rico).


  She heard her mom and dad arguing in the kitchen.


  Her dad might have been drunk,


 I don't recall if my mom said.


  She heard her mom screaming and then go silent.


  Her dad had stabbed her mom to death.


  He went to prison.


  My mom and her siblings got adopted out to other families.
