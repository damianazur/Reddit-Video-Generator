A guy I hooked up with in college had a breakdown when we were black out drunk and essentially admitted to killing a guy who had taken advantage of his little sister and burying the body.


 <br>He was a total wiener of a guy who was always trying to hype himself up and exaggerate to be a bigger,


 better,


 “manlier” person so I didn’t think much of it at the time.


 The timing would have made him a teenager and the man a full fledged adult.


 It just felt like another bullshit story he was always telling.


 But sometimes I think back and wonder if there’s any truth to it.
