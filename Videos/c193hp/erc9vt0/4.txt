As a young teenager one of my closest female friend was raped by her cousin (who was the same age as her) multiple times over the course of 3 years.


 Eventually her father found out about this and a trial happened.


 That cousin ended up having nothing much more than a fine and kind of a "warning we watch over you now".


 This guy is now on the run to compete in the nex Olympic Games,


 and my friend is fucking broken from the inside and barely able to trust males.


 I'm one of the few persons outside of the family who knows.
