It was in 6th grade,


 and I was about 11 years old at the time.


 A girl in my class had been missing from school for quite a while.


 We asked our teacher what the problem was,


 but she refused to answer.


 We then kind of just let it slide and didn't think about it anymore.


 A few weeks later,


 there was a story in the news about a 12 year old girl,


 who had been impregnated by a 39 year old man.


 We joked around saying that it was probably her,


 until she finally came to class one morning and told everyone that it was true.


  I have literally never seen a classroom that silent before in my life.
