My classmate in high school,


 I thought he was pretty weird but also a nice guy.


 Turned out he s bipolar and he manages it with medication.


 But one time he was off it and he lost control in an argument with his little brother.


 He ended up beating the living crap out of the poor kid.


 Once he regained his senses and realized what he did,


 he tried to kill himself.


 I m not sure how,


 he didn t specify.


 His dad was also an abusive drunk douchebag,


 who occasionally beat him up.


 He told the story pretty calmly.


 I really hope he s doing much better now.
