Thanks to therapy and my sisters' support,


 I've gone from being suicidal to being hopeful.


 I'm learning to overcome obstacles that once seemed insurmountable,


 and I can finally imagine myself living past the next few years.


As long as you're still alive,


 there's still hope.


 Life can get better and I'm **going** to fix mine,


 dammit!
