All 7 of my Honeybee colonies are currently surviving the winter,


 and today they're bringing in the first pollen of the year.


 Edit: Also,


 please support Native Bees (for why and how at home,


 check out: Bringing Nature Home by Douglas Tallamy),


 as well as *butterflies like the Monarch,


 and bats!
