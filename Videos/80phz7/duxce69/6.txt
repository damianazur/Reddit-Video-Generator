The possible return of the American Chestnut tree.


 Fast growing,


 rot resistant and,


 perhaps most important,


 it produces enough calories from the nuts to feed a population.


 Edit: It turned out that someone from WBUR in Boston saw the interest in this post and wrote an article and made a podcast about it.


 It's very good!
