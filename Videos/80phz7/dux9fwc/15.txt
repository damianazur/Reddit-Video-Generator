That we're almost at the point where we get artificial organs.


  I could use a kidney.


Edit: guys,


 thanks a lot for your support,


 understanding and most of all the selfless offers you've made,


 bel it a kidney or info.


 I love you all.


Edit 2: I wish I could share some Resources on how to be a living donor.


 If someone could help me in that front so I could share it here.


 I'm not from the states and I don't know where to start.


 This is the most humbling experience I've had on reddit yet.


Edit 3: thanks to /u/ragnaruckus for this resource on living donation   to /u/tambourine-time for this other resource.


 Please,


 if your thinking of donating,


 have a look at these resources
