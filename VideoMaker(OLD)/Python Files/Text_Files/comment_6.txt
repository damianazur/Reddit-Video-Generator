Matt was a friend of mine in elementary school. He was considered weird because he had a fascination with video 

games and graphic design and just general nerd shit. I remember he built a custom skeleton and texture for a character 

to play as in Unreal Tournament. It had inverted knees, ran really low to the ground, and a fully animated tail. It was the 

coolest thing. Well back in the 90s in our school that shit was bullseye bully material. I never bullied him, but to my 

everlasting shame I never ONCE stood up for him as a friend or even a decent human being. He doesn't do anything 

with computers anymore. He has taken over his gpas farm. Noble but he had SO much passion and talent and I was 

party to killing that passion.
