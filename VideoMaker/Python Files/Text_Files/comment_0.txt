Back in high school we had this one kid who everyone referred too as 'Bounce Boy'.

He earned this nickname by spending both morning break and lunch hopping along the outside perimeter of the yard 

for as long as he could between classes. Every single break, rain or shine - you could rely on bounce boy being out doing 

his rounds.

After a while me and a few friends stopped him and asked if we could join in.

He seemed a bit awkward and said "It's more of a one player game".

And with that - off he went back on his bounce round.

We asked him a few more times and eventually he gave in. He was quite the recognizable figure at that point so others 

started to join.

In the end we got about 20 people hopping round with him. He didn't like the attention at first but after a bit he realized 

we're all just being friendly and warmed up to us a bit.

I'll never forget you bounce boy.

Bounce on, brother.
